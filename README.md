# Permutation-Flow-Shop-Warm-Start

The permutation flow shop scheduling problem is one of the most classic ones in the litterature. It can be briefly described as follows: given a set of machines m and a set of jobs n, how to process those jobs in the machines such that every job has to go through the machines in the same order and minimizing the completion time.
